&lt;p>This research introduces &lt;strong>Attention Windows&lt;/strong>, a novel framework for measuring the cognitive span required by listeners to follow lyrical narratives. How long can a theme persist before the lyrics shift to something new? Building on previous semantic embedding analyses of the Beatles and Pink Floyd, we develop a multi-method approach to quantify this narrative architecture across two iconic albums: &lt;em>The Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Abbey Road&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Core Finding (UNEXPECTED):&lt;/strong> The analysis reveals a surprising inversion of our initial hypothesis. The Beatles exhibit significantly longer attention windows (μ = 0.57 lines, SD = 1.48) than Pink Floyd (μ = 0.25 lines, SD = 0.97) when measured with OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s text-embedding-ada-002 at its calibrated threshold (θ = 0.85). This counterintuitive result (p &amp;lt; 0.001) illuminates something fundamental about musical structure: the Beatles&amp;rsquo; verse-chorus repetition creates strong measurable coherence between consecutive lines, while Pink Floyd&amp;rsquo;s through-composed, non-repetitive approach—precisely what makes them feel &amp;ldquo;thematically sustained&amp;rdquo;—actually produces lower line-to-line similarity. The metric, it turns out, captures structural repetition rather than abstract thematic continuity, offering unexpected insights into how pop and progressive rock architectures differ at the semantic level.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
