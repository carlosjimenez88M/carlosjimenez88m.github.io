How long can a theme persist before the lyrics shift to something new? Building on previous semantic embedding analyses of the Beatles and Pink Floyd, we develop a multi-method approach to quantify this narrative architecture across two iconic albums: \u003cem\u003eThe Dark Side of the Moon\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAbbey Road\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCore Finding (UNEXPECTED):\u003c/strong\u003e The analysis reveals a surprising inversion of our initial hypothesis. The Beatles exhibit significantly longer attention windows (μ = 0.57 lines, SD = 1.48) than Pink Floyd (μ = 0.25 lines, SD = 0.97) when measured with OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s text-embedding-ada-002 at its calibrated threshold (θ = 0.85). This counterintuitive result (p \u0026lt; 0.001) illuminates something fundamental about musical structure: the Beatles\u0026rsquo; verse-chorus repetition creates strong measurable coherence between consecutive lines, while Pink Floyd\u0026rsquo;s through-composed, non-repetitive approach—precisely what makes them feel \u0026ldquo;thematically sustained\u0026rdquo;—actually produces lower line-to-line similarity. The metric, it turns out, captures structural repetition rather than abstract thematic continuity, offering unexpected insights into how pop and progressive rock architectures differ at the semantic level.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["llms","nlp","music-analysis","embeddings"],"title":"Attention Windows: A Novel Framework for Measuring Narrative Cognitive Load in Beatles vs Pink Floyd","type":"post","url":"/post/2026-02-10-attention-windows-beatles-floyd/","weight":0,"wordcount":4058},{"author":null,"categories":["MLOps","Engineering"],"content":"Part 1: Philosophy, project architecture and orchestration with Hydra + MLflow.
