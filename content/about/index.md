## About Me




* I'm Colombian!
* Iâ€™m currently a Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Lead Advocate ðŸ¥‘ and AI Programmer.
* I studied Philosophy and History, Economics, Computer Science, and of course, Artificial Intelligence.
* I have an obsession with vinyl records, books, and own an unnecessarily large guitar collection.
* Iâ€™ve lived in the USA, Chile, Mexico, Spain, and Colombia.
* Iâ€™m a teacher in two specific subjects: Applied Statistics for Machine Learning and Economic History.
* I love Edge Computing and work with a Jetson Nano for Computer Vision and some LLM applications, and with a Raspberry Pi for MLOps and AI Programming with different HATs (I also use it as my personal server, often paired with my iPad).
* My research focuses on computational methods applied to Health Sciences, and on sampling strategies for segmentation control in training data.
* Iâ€™m currently migrating all my applications to CUDA to make them more efficient.
* Fun fact: Iâ€™m building a library dedicated to Jules Verne.
* What I enjoy most in life is being a father, so all my time outside of work is with my daughters.
* As a child, I wanted to be a tattoo artist and musicianâ€”now, as an adult, I want to open my own school in the Caribbean.
