## Who I Am

I've spent the last decade figuring out how to take ML models out of Jupyter notebooks and put them somewhere useful. Not "useful" like a Kaggle leaderboard — useful like predicting inventory for Mercado Libre, where a wrong forecast means empty shelves or wasted stock across Latin America.

My path wasn't linear. I started with statistics at the UN and the Inter-American Development Bank, where I learned that the fanciest model means nothing if it can't run on the infrastructure a developing country actually has. Then Yale, where I got obsessed with computational methods. Then Mercado Libre and Globant, where I learned what "production" really means when millions of users are involved.

Somewhere along the way, I bought a Raspberry Pi to test a deployment. Then another. Then I realized: if I could make MLflow run on this $35 board, I could teach anyone to do MLOps without needing a cloud bill that looks like a phone number.

## What I Write About

Now I write about the intersection of three things most people treat as separate worlds:

**MLOps** — because a model that isn't in production is just a very expensive hypothesis

**Edge Computing** — because not everything can (or should) live in the cloud

**Agentic AI** — because the future isn't models that answer questions, it's systems that take action

## How I Work

I build on Raspberry Pi, Jetson Orin, and anything else that forces me to care about constraints. I've taught this stuff in Colombia, Mexico, Chile, and Spain. I'm also weirdly into economic history and collect vinyl records, but that's for another conversation.

If you're an engineer trying to deploy ML somewhere that isn't a pristine AWS environment, this blog is for you.
