&lt;li>Data cleaning and preliminary analysis process&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding the emotional charge or plot development of texts through semantic archaeology based on PCAs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding the connections and most representative ideas within the document set&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Understanding a story&amp;rsquo;s behavior at the level of its variance is a challenge addressed by attentional engineering. Therefore, using lesser-known methods such as the &lt;strong>vector narrative arc&lt;/strong> combined with a &lt;strong>literary map&lt;/strong> constitutes an interesting route to address increasingly common problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MLflow for Generative AI Systems</title><link>https://carlosdanieljimenez.com/post/mlflow_genai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlosdanieljimenez.com/post/mlflow_genai/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mlflow-for-generative-ai-systems">MLflow for Generative AI Systems&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll start this post by recalling what Hayen said in her book &lt;strong>Designing Machine Learning Systems (2022): &amp;lsquo;Systems are meant to learn&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/strong> This statement reflects a simple fact: today, LLMs and to a lesser extent vision language models are winning in the Data Science world. But how do we measure this learning? RLHF work is always a good indicator that perplexity will improve, but let&amp;rsquo;s return to a key point: LLMs must work as a system, therefore debugging is important, and that&amp;rsquo;s where the necessary tool for every Data Scientist, AI Engineer, ML Engineer, and MLOps Engineer comes in: MLflow.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
